    <h1>Dylan's Reflection Blog</h1>
    <p>
    After watching the Shereef's Fireside Chat the idea that really sticks with me is the whole theory of the 'Restaurant Mindset'. Not falling into this trap of feeling entitled or owed, whether it be  by EDA or other classmates . I am excited by this idea and how it will going to grow me as a person, by not seeing life as a consumer process
</p>

<p>
I believe that the potential to go into this experience ready to get involved and really take every day not as a package deal but as an opportunity. Not having the knowledge force fed, yet something we must seize. This different form of education is what will really enhance the opportunities  that arise. Being able to fix it ourselves rather than be told how it needs to be done and working together to find the best outcome.
</p>
<p>
As this isn't just a educational process but a cultural experience I feel the only true way to respond  is Carpe Diem. That I must seize the day and take this opportunity and this different approach to learning to new heights.
</p>
<p>
My expectations of EDA haven't changed, but the expectation of myself have. That I must be willing to go into this as an adventure with both eyes open and ready to share that experience with others.
</p>
<p>
This type of learning environment does excite me. I think personally that it will be the perfect fit for me. Being in this creator mode rather than consumer mode is what I look forward to the most
