    <h3>Analogy</h3>
      <p>I did want to use my own analogy, however Udacity sums this up just too perfectly. HTML is the foundations and structure for the building, you have the wall and the different rooms the floor etc. CSS is like the paint on the walls and the decorations inside all the differences to make your web page stand out. JavaScript is how we interact with the house, so the remote to your television, the light switch all the parts to the house that are changeable.</p>
  <h3>Boxifying Design</h3>

      <p>Boxifying Design is all about how you can divide the Web Page into different Boxes. As all pages in the most simplified form are how each part of the page creates a Box. This becomes a useful tool when creating the layout to a webpage.</p>

  <h3>What is the box model?</h3>

      <p>As each part of a page is part of a box the box model divides up these boxes into content, padding, border and the margin. Using this tool you can make the boxes larger or smaller, make them close together of separate them.</p>
